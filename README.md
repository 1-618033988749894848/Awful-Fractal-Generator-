# Awful-Fractal-Generator-
Generates some escape time fractals like the Mandelbrot, Julia set, and Burning Ship fractals. Generation time is slow and unoptimized, may take 20 minutes or more to render something well. 
There's a part in the main while true loop I've labeled, you just need to change the function inside to one of the commented functions, and then comment out the previous function.
